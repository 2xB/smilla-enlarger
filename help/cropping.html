<h2><b>Cropping</b></h2>

<p>In the tab on the right side, titled '<b>Cropping</b>', you can select a region
   of your image for enlarging. When you hold down the mouse within this view
   and drag it around, you will see that a frame appears, the cropping rectangle.
   It won't disappear when you release the mouse.
   You can move it by grabbing its interior or resize it by grabbing the frame.
   To make it disappear, click anywhere outside the rectangle.
</p>

<p>The contents of this cropping rectangle are enlarged when you click '<b>Enlarge&amp;Save</b>'.
   If no rectangle is defined, the complete input image is enlarged.
</p>

<p>In the combo box under the picture you can select one of several
   fixed <b>cropping formats</b> for the rectangle, for example  '<b>square</b>', 
   or '<b>1 : sqrt(2)</b>' (the format of a normal Din A4 paper).<br>
   Use '<b>free</b>' to allow arbitrary cropping.
</p>

<p>After clicking '<b>Center View</b>' the view will center around the selected region.
   This is useful for fine adjustments if you have marked a very small part of the input.

<h2><b>Specifying the Output Dimensions</b></h2>


<p>The size of the result is displayed under the <b>Thumbnail Preview</b>.
   To change it, you can use one of several methods listed in the <b>combo box</b>
   directly under the header 'Output Dimensions' on the left.
</p>
<p>The methods are:
   <ul>
     <li><b>Specify zoom factor</b> - directly set a percentage for the enlarged dimensions
     </li>
     <li><b>Specify width of result</b> - give desired number of pixels for the width of the output image
     </li>
     <li><b>Specify height of result</b> - give desired number of pixels for the height of the output image
     </li>
     <li><b>Fit inside boundary</b> - set maximal pixel values for width and height of the result.
        The Enlarger will choose the maximal dimensions fitting into this boundary.
     </li>
     <li><b>Stretch to fit</b> - set the pixel values for width and height of the result.
        The Enlarger will stretch the image to fit into this rectangle, possibly
        changing the aspect ratio.
     </li>
     <li><b>Crop to fit</b> - set the pixel values for width and height of the result.
        The image will be enlarged to cover the given rectangle, the overlapping parts are cut away.
        ( You can additionally change the aspect ratio by changing 'StretchX' )
     </li>
     <li><b>Fit inside, add bars</b> - set the pixel values for width and height of the result.
        The image will be enlarged to fit inside the given rectangle, which then is filled up with black margins.
     </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>For each of these methods you can get an impression how it works by changing the size and format
   of the <b>cropping rectangle</b> and watching the effects and displayed size in the <b>Thumbnail Preview</b>.
   Some methods are mostly useful for <a href="batch.html">Batch Processing</a>.

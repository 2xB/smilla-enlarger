<h2><b>Batch Processing</b></h2>

<p>SmillaEnlarger can automatically process a batch of images with the same settings:
</p>

<p>If you <b>drop a folder</b> onto the enlarger,
   the contents are scanned for images of supported type (subfolders are ignored). To those images the current
   <a href="parameterTab.html">parameters</a> and the <b>resizing method</b> chosen in the
   <a href="dimensions.html">Output Dimensions</a> box are applied <b>at once</b>. The new jobs are moved to the queue <b>automatically</b>,
   you don't have to press 'Enlarge&amp;Save'.
</p>

<p>The results are put into a <b>new folder</b>, the name is that of the source with an appended '_e'.
</p>

<p>Also, when you drop multiple files, those are likewise pushed into the queue automatically, but in this case no new folder
 is created for the batch results.
</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Before dropping more than one file, check if all settings are as you want, especially look under
   '<b>Write Result to:</b>' in which <b>folder</b> the results will be saved (&nbsp;probably you will want to uncheck 'Use Source Folder' and give
   a new location where your batch results are saved together&nbsp;).

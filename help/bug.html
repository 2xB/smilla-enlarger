<h2><b>Bug Reporting</b></h2>
<p>If you have found a bug, you can report it using the
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=268170&atid=1141102">Bug Tracking</a>
   of the SourceForge site. There you can create a new entry by clicking '<b>Add new</b>'.
   But before doing so, read the existing bug reports, maybe something similar is reported yet.
   In this case, add a comment to the existing entry.
</p>
<p>Please only report something if you can provide precise and detailed information and have thoroughly
   verified the existence of the bug. You might take a look into SmillaEnlarger's <b>Log tab</b> and
   paste parts of the log into your comment if they seem helpful.

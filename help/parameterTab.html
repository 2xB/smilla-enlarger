<h2><b>The Parameter Tab</b></h2>
<p>On the right side you can choose a tab titled '<b>Parameter</b>'.
   There you can preview a part of the output image with the desired zoom. 
   (You find it in the same tabbed view as this help, click
   onto 'Parameter' above). This view shows <b>only a part</b> of the result.
    It is only for giving you an impression of the zoom and for testing enlarging parameters.
</p>
<p>
   You can <b>drag around the contents</b> with the mouse.
   When you click somewhere in the little '<b>Thumbnail Preview</b>' on the left,
   the region around this point is displayed magnified in the right view.
</p>

<p>By clicking onto the <b>Preview</b> button, you can see what the enlarger does with the
   contents of the magnified view.
</p>

<p>In the Parameter Tab you can adjust some enlargement parameters:
   <ul>
    <li><b>Sharpness:</b> higher values lead to sharper edges, might look artificial if too sharp</li>
    <li><b>Flatness: </b>higher values produce more 'painted' looking results with less gradients</li>
    <li><b>PreSharpen:</b> applies simple sharpening to the source before enlarging</li>
    <li><b>Dithering:</b> add a slightly analogue looking grain-structure to the result</li>
    <li><b>DeNoise:</b> remove some noise and artifacts from the source</l>
    <li><b>FractNoise:</b> just a gimmick: get some irregularity into your result;
        contours and colors are modified by plasma fractal noise.</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>You can switch between predefined settings in the <b>combo box</b>.<br />
   To change a  setting, first check '<b>Allow Changes</b>'.<br />
   You can create a new set cloning the current one by clicking '<b>New</b>'.
   For a new settings name type something into the combo box, don't forget to hit
   the '<b>'Return</b>' key at the end to adopt the changed name.

<h2><b>Drop and Paste</b></h2>

<p>SmillaEnlarger supports Drag&amp;Drop: You can drag a file or image from any folder or
   from another program offering Drag&amp;Drop and drop it onto the enlarger window.
   The enlarger then tries to open it as new source.
</p>

<p>If you drop a folder or multiple images at once, automatic <a href="batch.html">batch processing</a>
   is started instead of displaying a new source.
</p>
<p>You also can paste the contents of the clipboard, i.e. use <b>Copy</b> within another program on
   a file or image and then in SmillaEnlarger call <b>Paste</b> from the File Menu (&nbsp;or press
   <b>Ctrl&nbsp;V</b> / <b>Cmd&nbsp;V</b>&nbsp;) to load it into the enlarger.
</p>

<p>(&nbsp;This might not work in all cases. SmillaEnlarger tries to cope with things you throw
    at it, but will probably not always succeed.&nbsp;)

<h2><b>Saving the Result</b></h2>

<p>After <a href="dimensions.html">specifying the dimensions</a> of the result and maybe
   <a href="parameterTab.html">changing some parameters</a>, enlarging can begin:
</p>
<p>
   To calculate and  save the enlarged version of the (&nbsp;<a href="cropping.html">possibly cropped</a>&nbsp;)
   input image,<br />
   press <b>'Enlarge&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Save'</b>.
</p>

<p>Under the header <b>Write Result to:</b>' on the bottom left,
   you can see where the result will be saved.
   The enlarger automatically chooses the source name and type
   with an appended _e and a number as the result's filename, but you can enter something
   else as long as the ending belongs to one of the supported image types. The appended number
   is increased if you enlarge several parts of the same source. By default the enlarged picture
   is written into the source folder, uncheck <b>'Use&nbsp;Source&nbsp;Folder'</b> and click
   <b>'Change&nbsp;Folder'</b> to choose something different. Supported types for saving are<br /><br />
   <b>JPG</b>, <b>TIF</b>, <b>BMP</b>, <b>PPM</b> and <b>PNG</b>.
</p>
<p>You can set your preferred output format and 
   (for <b>JPEG</b> images) the output <b>quality</b> in the Preferences dialog.
</p>

<p>The new job is pushed into the <a href="jobQueue.html">Job Queue</a> and processed in the background,
   you can directly continue working with the enlarger.
</p>
<p>Changes of enlarger settings <b>don't have any influence on existing jobs</b>.<br />
   The settings of the job (size, destination, parameters) are those present at the moment of pressing
   '<b>Enlarge&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Save</b>', they can not be changed afterwards.

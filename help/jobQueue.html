<h2><b>The Job Queue</b></h2>
<p>SmillaEnlarger now makes use of a <b>Job Queue</b>. New calculations are
   appended to a list of jobs, the entries of the list are then by and by given to the
   calculation threads in the background, while you can continue your work at once.
   The progress of the job queue is shown by the progress bar at the bottom left of the window .
   For detailed information about the jobs in the queue, open the <b>Jobs Tab</b>.
</p>
<p>In this tab you can <b>clear</b> the complete queue, discarding all running and waiting
   calculations.<br />
   Or select one job and click '<b>remove job</b>' to kill it.<br />
   With '<b>clean up</b>' you remove all finished jobs from the list.
